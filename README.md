## What OxideTerm Is

OxideTerm is an open-source, local-first workspace for connecting to servers and working across terminals, files, forwarding, host tools, and remote desktops.

**What you can do:**

- Manage SSH, Mosh, Telnet, Serial, RDP/VNC, SFTP, port forwards, local shells, and lightweight editing in one native workspace
- Keep remote work alive through network hiccups with Grace Period reconnect
- Ask OxideSens AI to inspect live sessions and perform approved workspace actions through your own AI provider
- Load bounded Agent Skills and use the advanced terminal command sender for scheduled, repeatable, multi-target input

Your connections and operational data stay under your control. OxideTerm requires no account, uses your own AI provider when OxideSens is enabled, and keeps the desktop experience free of Electron and bundled browser runtimes.

---

## Why OxideTerm?

| If you care about... | OxideTerm gives you... |
|---|---|
| One remote node, many tools | Terminal, SFTP, port forwarding, RDP/VNC, trzsz, native IDE, monitoring, and OxideSens AI stay attached to the same workspace |
| A desktop app without Electron or a bundled WebView | GPUI draws the interface directly on a GPU surface, without shipping a browser runtime |
| Local-first operations workflows | SSH, Telnet, SFTP, forwarding, RDP/VNC, local shell, serial terminals, and config work without signup |
| BYOK OxideSens AI instead of platform credits | OxideSens uses your OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini/Ollama/OpenAI-compatible endpoint with MCP, RAG, provider-aware reasoning controls, and approved workspace actions |
| Reconnect stability | Grace Period probes the old connection for 30s before replacing it, so TUI apps can survive short network drops |
| Pure-Rust SSH and credential safety | The SSH stack uses `russh` + `ring` without OpenSSL/libssh2; stored credentials use the OS keychain, and `.oxide` bundles use ChaCha20-Poly1305 + Argon2id |

## Built for Remote Operations

OxideTerm keeps terminal rendering, connection state, reconnect orchestration, files, forwarding, automation, and AI context inside one Rust application. The result is a workspace in which tools share the same server identity and session lifecycle instead of behaving like disconnected utilities.

| Aspect | Bundled browser approach | OxideTerm |
|---|---|---|
| **Rendering** | Browser engine and web layout | GPUI on a GPU surface |
| **Terminal data flow** | WebSocket → JS event loop → xterm.js | Rust input → `TerminalState` mutation → GPUI render |
| **Connection lifecycle** | Split across frontend and backend layers | One in-process connection and reconnect pipeline |
| **AI context** | Copied through an application bridge | Built from the active workspace with user approval |
| **Plugin runtime** | Browser scripting environment | Manifest-only, capability-scoped WASM, and trusted process runtimes |
| **CLI** | Requires the desktop app running | Standalone binary, direct crate linkage |
| **Runtime boundary** | Desktop wrapper plus browser runtime | Native process with no bundled browser runtime |

## Under the Hood

OxideTerm keeps terminal, SSH, Telnet, RDP, VNC, SFTP, forwarding, editing, AI, plugins, and CLI in one Rust architecture. The implementation notes below are for readers who want the engineering details.

<details>
<summary><strong>Architecture, SSH internals, GPUI shell, reconnect, AI, plugins, and more</strong></summary>
<br>

### Architecture — In-Process Core, No WebView Bridge

GPUI and the terminal/SSH backend share one Rust process; optional remote agents and platform helpers remain outside this boundary:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│               GPUI Render Loop                  │
│   WorkspaceApp  ·  Tab surfaces  ·  GPUI views  │
└──────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                       │  in-process Arc<> / async
┌──────────────────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│             Domain Crates (Rust async)           │
│  NodeRouter → SshConnectionRegistry             │
│  TerminalState ← SSH PTY channel (russh)        │
│  SftpSession · ForwardingRuntime · IdeWorkspace │
│  Ai/ACP Entities · CloudSync · Plugin Runtimes  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

There is no serialization boundary between the UI and the SSH/terminal backend. Terminal bytes mutate `TerminalState` directly — no JSON, no WebSocket, no Base64, no xterm.js parse pass. GPUI reads the state and emits GPU draw calls.

### 🔩 Pure Rust SSH — russh (ring)

The desktop app links the `russh` stack directly:

- **No OpenSSL/libssh2 in the SSH stack** — SSH cryptography is provided through `ring`
- Full SSH2: key exchange, channels, SFTP subsystem, port forwarding
- ChaCha20-Poly1305 and AES-GCM, Ed25519/RSA/ECDSA keys
- SSH Agent: Unix (`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`) and Windows (`\\.\pipe\openssh-ssh-agent`)
- Custom `AgentSigner` for russh `Signer` trait compatibility across `.await` bounds
- Multi-hop proxy chains with per-hop independent auth

### 🔄 Smart Reconnect with Grace Period

Reconnect is coordinated by one Rust pipeline:

1. **Detect** SSH keepalive timeout (Rust async task, no JS timer throttling)
2. **Snapshot** terminal panes, SFTP transfers, forwards, IDE files — all in-process
3. **Grace Period** (30 s): probe old SSH connection via keepalive; TUI apps survive on network switch
4. New SSH connection → restore forwards → resume transfers → reopen IDE files

Pipeline: `queued → snapshot → grace-period → ssh-connect → await-terminal → restore-forwards → resume-transfers → restore-ide → verify → done`

### 🛡️ SSH Connection Pool

`SshConnectionRegistry` is backed by `DashMap`; the workspace uses it through `NodeRouter` and runtime entities:

- **Default shared connection**: terminal panes, SFTP, port forwards, and IDE can share one physical SSH connection
- **Optional dedicated terminal**: a terminal policy can create its own registry key and physical connection without changing the shared node connection
- **State machine per connection**: `connecting → active → idle → link_down → reconnecting`
- **Node-first addressing**: everything is resolved by `nodeId` → `connectionId` by `NodeRouter`
- **NodeRuntimeStore**: in-process node runtime and serializable topology snapshot; `WorkspaceApp` helpers persist the snapshot to `session_tree.json`, while live handles are rebuilt on startup
- **Cascade propagation**: jump host failure → downstream nodes automatically marked `link_down`

`ConnectionRegistry` owns physical connections, health state, consumers, and idle cleanup. `WorkspaceRuntimeEntity` schedules probes and reconnect jobs. AI and plugins use capability handles, host snapshots, or terminal hooks rather than registering as physical connection consumers.

### 🤖 OxideSens AI

OxideSens is BYOK-first, with context building performed in-process:

- **Providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Google Gemini, Ollama/any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **MCP**: stdio + SSE transports, full tool discovery and invocation
- **RAG**: BM25 full-text + HNSW vector index, Reciprocal Rank Fusion, CJK bigram tokenizer
- **Context boundary**: provider-bound messages pass through credential-pattern redaction, while the user controls which workspace context and actions are approved
- **API keys**: stored in the OS keychain and deliberately excluded from structured logs and desktop-core message payloads

### 🎨 GPUI Desktop Shell

The entire UI is written in Rust using GPUI (Zed's GPU-backed UI framework):

- **No CSS, no DOM, no JavaScript** in the rendering pipeline
- **Workspace tab types**: local terminal, SSH, Telnet, Serial, RDP, VNC, SFTP, IDE, port forwards, session manager, cloud sync, settings, plugins, topology, monitoring, file manager, launcher, graphics, and custom plugin tabs
- **Split pane system**: binary pane tree, draggable dividers, up to 4 panes per terminal tab
- **Command palette**, global key bindings, sidebar panels — all GPUI primitives
- **Immediate-mode rendering**: UI reflects Rust state changes without a serialization round-trip

### 🧱 Terminal State and Rendering

Terminal rendering is modeled as Rust state first, then drawn by GPUI:

- PTY output lands in `TerminalState`; scrollback, cursor, selection, marks, and search state stay in Rust
- Rendering policy can shift between Boost, Normal, and Idle without asking a browser event loop to cooperate
- Sixel and Kitty graphics are tracked as terminal-owned assets instead of DOM nodes or canvas overlays
- Split panes share the same workspace state model, so tab restore and reconnect can snapshot terminal topology together

### 🗂️ SFTP and IDE Workspace

Remote files are part of the same node workspace rather than a separate disconnected feature:

- SFTP sessions are resolved through `NodeRouter` and carry a connection generation; reconnect reacquires an eligible session, but an old-generation operation is never silently replaced by a new connection
- Transfer queues track direction, progress, retry state, and speed limits independently from the visible file panes
- IDE tabs keep dirty buffers, remote paths, conflict state, and restore metadata together
- Remote writes use staged/atomic behavior where the backend supports it, keeping partial writes out of normal edit flows

### 🧩 Plugins, CLI, and Diagnostics

Extension and support surfaces stay inside explicit Rust-owned boundaries:

- Plugins support manifest-only, WASM, and ordinary process paths. WASM uses Wasmtime/WASI or a sidecar with controlled host calls; process plugins are local processes without an OS sandbox. Legacy Tauri ESM plugins may be shown but are not executed by Native.
- The CLI links directly to domain crates for settings, connections, forwards, plugins, quick commands, secrets, portable bundles, diagnostics, reports, batch plans, backups, and cloud sync
- Diagnostics prefer counts, paths, feature flags, and redacted hints over raw secret-bearing payloads
- Mutating CLI flows use dry-run plans, `--yes` guards, and rollback backups where applicable

### 🔀 Port Forwarding — Lock-Free I/O

Forwarding is implemented as a standalone Rust crate:

- Local (-L), Remote (-R), Dynamic SOCKS5 (-D)
- Message-passing architecture: SSH Channel owned by single `ssh_io` task — no `Arc<Mutex<Channel>>`
- Auto-restore on reconnect, death reporting, idle timeout

### 📦 trzsz — In-Band File Transfer

The in-band protocol is integrated directly with native file dialogs:

- Upload/download through the existing terminal stream — no extra ports or agents
- Works through ProxyJump chains
- Native file pickers (no browser memory constraints)
- Bidirectional, directory support, configurable limits

### 🔐 .oxide Encrypted Export

Portable exports use:

- **ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD** authenticated encryption
- **Argon2id KDF**: 256 MB memory cost, 4 iterations — GPU brute-force resistant
- Covers: connections, forwards, settings, quick commands, plugin settings, portable secrets

## Run From Source

**Requirements:** Rust toolchain (Edition 2024), desktop environment capable of running GPUI.

```sh
# Run the app
cargo run

# If the renderer fails on your machine, try the compatibility profile
OXIDETERM_RENDER_PROFILE=compatibility cargo run
```

```sh
# Build the headless CLI companion
./scripts/build/build-cli.sh

# Build the optional Linux remote agent
./scripts/build/build-agent.sh
```

CLI artifacts land in `crates/oxideterm-gpui-app/resources/cli-bin/<target-triple>/oxideterm`.

---

The headless `oxideterm` CLI works without launching the app — useful for automation, CI, and diagnostics.

```sh
cargo run -p oxideterm-cli -- doctor --strict
cargo run -p oxideterm-cli -- settings validate --strict --json
cargo run -p oxideterm-cli -- connections search prod
cargo run -p oxideterm-cli -- forwards list --format json
cargo run -p oxideterm-cli -- cloud-sync push --dry-run --json
cargo run -p oxideterm-cli -- oxide export ./profile.oxide --connection prod --password-stdin
cargo run -p oxideterm-cli -- report --bundle ./oxideterm-report.zip
cargo run -p oxideterm-cli -- completion install zsh --force

# Path/profile isolation for CI or fixture testing
cargo run -p oxideterm-cli -- --config-dir ./fixture-config doctor --strict
```
