# OxideTerm Native Architecture

> **Version**: Native desktop architecture
> **Last updated**: 2026-07-31
> **Workspace version**: Cargo workspace `2.0.15`
> **Reference style**: based on the Tauri architecture documents and retained for migration context; the Rust/GPUI native app is the implementation source of truth.

This document describes the OxideTerm Native system architecture, design decisions, and core components. It follows the same architectural writing style as the Tauri reference: start with principles, show the whole system, separate data and control paths, then describe each subsystem and its lifecycle.

## Design Principles

### Core Principles

1. **Desktop app first** - The GPUI desktop app is the primary user surface. The CLI is a companion for automation and diagnostics.
2. **Terminal responsiveness** - Terminal input, output, resize, and rendering are latency-sensitive hot-path work.
3. **Node-first remote workspace** - Remote workflows are anchored by a stable SSH node, not by a transient terminal pane.
4. **Default shared connection** - Terminal, SFTP, forwarding, and IDE can share a node's registry connection; AI and plugins use validated capability handles, snapshots, or hooks rather than becoming physical connection consumers.
5. **Explicit lifecycle ownership** - Saved profiles, live nodes, terminal sessions, SFTP sessions, forwards, editor buffers, and tabs have different owners.
6. **Local-first state** - SSH, SFTP, local terminal, settings, plugins, and AI provider configuration work without an OxideTerm cloud account.
7. **Secret separation** - Navigation metadata, settings, AI prompts, logs, support bundles, and plugin labels are not secret storage.
8. **Minimum visible coupling** - User-facing surfaces should not require users to reason about internal transport handles.

### Why Rust + GPUI

| Concern | Native Rust/GPUI Direction |
|---|---|
| User experience | One desktop workspace for terminal, files, forwarding, IDE, AI, settings, and plugins |
| Backend ownership | Core rules and models live in Rust domain crates; `oxideterm-gpui-app` owns coordinating Entities, subscriptions, and final runtime shutdown instead of treating them as ad hoc view state |
| Terminal path | Terminal input/output stays isolated from heavy management work |
| Safety | SSH, SFTP, forwarding, persistence, secrets, and AI boundaries are explicit Rust domains |
| Portability | Desktop package can include app resources, agent binaries, icons, and CLI companion |
| Maintainability | Crates split by responsibility rather than by screen or file size |

### User-Facing Summary

The app is a workspace shell around stable remote nodes. Tabs and panes are views. Saved connections are profiles. SSH nodes are live or reconnecting runtime objects. Terminal sessions, SFTP sessions, IDE workspaces, and forwards consume node capabilities directly; AI targets and plugin surfaces use validated capability handles, host snapshots, or terminal hooks.

That separation explains common behavior:

- Closing a terminal tab does not delete the saved connection.
- A node may remain visible in Connection Monitor after a pane closes.
- SFTP and IDE can recover after a reconnect because they are tied to the node, not only to a terminal pane.
- AI tools must select explicit targets before they run commands or read files.
- The CLI companion can inspect the same state, but it is not the main interactive surface.

---

## Two-Plane Architecture

The Tauri architecture describes a data plane and a control plane. Native GPUI removes the webview boundary, but the architectural split still applies.

### Data Plane

The data plane handles high-frequency terminal activity:

```text
terminal input
  -> terminal runtime
  -> local PTY or SSH shell channel
  -> terminal output
  -> terminal renderer
```

Properties:

- Low latency.
- High event volume.
- No dependence on cloud sync or backups.
- No user-visible confirmation flow for ordinary input.
- Rendering and input focus stay local to the terminal surface.

### Control Plane

The control plane handles structured management operations:

```text
user action or AI-approved tool
  -> workspace command
  -> domain runtime
  -> persistence / connection / file / sync action
  -> result, notification, or recovery hint
```

Examples:

- Create a saved connection.
- Open an SSH node.
- Start SFTP.
- Create a forward.
- Inspect host tools such as processes, Docker, services, tmux, packages, logs, ports, and filesystems.
- Open an IDE workspace.
- Open a graphics/VNC session.
- Confirm a terminal file-transfer prompt.
- Change a setting.
- Manage privilege credentials.
- Run a cloud-sync action.
- Execute an approved AI tool.
- Generate a support bundle.

### Persistence Plane

The persistence plane stores durable state:

- Settings.
- Saved connections.
- Forward rules.
- Plugin state.
- Privilege credential metadata.
- AI conversations and summaries.
- Cloud sync snapshots.
- Backups.
- Portable runtime metadata.

Secret-bearing data must cross into secret-aware storage rather than ordinary JSON/text fields. For privilege helpers, durable scope metadata can live with settings or saved connections, but the secret value belongs to the secret store.

## Native Workspace Layers

### Layer 1: GPUI Application Shell

Owned mainly by `oxideterm-gpui-app`, which is both the GPUI surface layer and
the coordinator for long-lived application entities.

Responsibilities:

- Create the desktop window.
- Render the activity bar, tabs, pane tree, dialogs, and settings surfaces.
- Route user actions to domain crates.
- Keep UI state separate from durable domain state while holding runtime entity
  handles, subscriptions, task delivery, and final shutdown ownership.
- Provide app-level notifications and command palette actions.

Representative modules:

```

### Layer 2: Domain Crates

Domain crates own reusable business logic and protocol models.

Examples:

- `oxideterm-ssh`: SSH configuration, connection registry, node routing, reconnect model.
- `oxideterm-sftp`: SFTP protocol/session and transfer semantics.
- `oxideterm-connections`: saved connection storage and validation.
- `oxideterm-forwarding`: forward rule model.
- `oxideterm-ai`: AI providers, context window logic, RAG, MCP, orchestrator tool definitions, policy.
- `oxideterm-settings`: settings load/save/mutation logic.
- `oxideterm-cloud-sync`: sync and backup logic.
- `oxideterm-plugin-*`: plugin manifest, protocol, registry, and host API types.

### Layer 3: Runtime Integrations

Runtime integrations bridge UI requests to active resources:

- Local terminal process.
- SSH shell channel.
- SFTP channel.
- Forward listener or remote forward.
- IDE file system access.
- Plugin host lifecycle.
- Cloud sync backend.
- AI provider requests.

The important rule is ownership: a runtime object should have one clear owner.
The app layer may own the coordinating Entity and its lifecycle while reusable
rules remain in domain crates; UI views consume runtime state through explicit
handles, subscriptions, or snapshots.

### Layer 4: Persistence And Secret Storage

Persistent state is shared by the desktop app and CLI companion. Secret values must not be serialized into ordinary settings, support bundles, AI context, or plugin labels.

---

## Node-First Runtime Model

### Problem Avoided

The Tauri Oxide-Next architecture identified a structural problem: SFTP, IDE, and forwarding should not depend on transient terminal session IDs. A terminal session can be recreated; the remote node is the stable unit of work.

Native keeps the same user-facing model.

### Current Topology

```text
saved connection
  -> node identity
       -> node runtime (`NodeRuntimeStore` + `NodeRouter`)
            -> shared or dedicated SSH connection handle
       -> terminal session(s)
       -> SFTP session
       -> forward rules
       -> IDE workspace
       -> AI capability handles
       -> plugin host snapshots and hooks
```

    Ide --> IdeTabs["IDE Tabs"]
    Forward --> ForwardSurface["Forwarding Surface"]
    AiTarget --> AiSidebar["OxideSens Sidebar"]
    PluginConsumers --> PluginSurfaces["Plugin Surfaces"]
```

### Stable And Transient Objects

| Object | Stable Role | Transient Implementation Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Saved connection | User profile | Current transport state |
| Node | Remote workspace identity | Current connection handle |
| Terminal tab | Visible shell view | Current PTY/channel instance |
| SFTP view | File workflow for node | Current SFTP channel |
| IDE workspace | Project/editing context | Current file operation channel |
| Forward rule | Desired tunnel | Current listener/task |
| AI target | Tool-facing snapshot | Current target state |

### User Rule

When something remote fails, check the node first. Do not assume the focused tab is the owner of the whole runtime.

### Jump-Host Ownership

Jump-host routing has two related ownership layers:

- `NodeRuntimeStore` records the logical parent/child node tree.
- `ConnectionRegistry` records the physical parent connection relationship and
  retains a parent consumer while a child connection depends on it.
- A child connection must not infer its parent from a matching hostname; it uses
  the exact node and connection identities.
- Explicit disconnect releases the child subtree before releasing the parent
  connection, so a child terminal cannot silently tear down a still-used hop.

---

## Desktop Workspace Architecture

### Workspace Shell

The workspace shell owns visible layout:

- Tabs.
- Pane tree.
- Activity bar.
- Sidebar.
- Command palette.
- Dialog stack.
- Notifications.

It should not own low-level SSH transport or secret material.

### Tabs

Tabs are visible surfaces. A tab can represent:

- Local terminal.
- SSH terminal.
- SFTP.
- IDE workspace.
- Settings.
- File manager.
- Plugin manager.
- Connection monitor.
- Cloud sync.

Tabs are closeable views. They are not the durable source of truth for saved connections or secrets.

### Activity Bar

The activity bar is the navigation entrypoint. It should take users to app surfaces, not expose low-level runtime handles.

### Notifications

Notifications turn asynchronous domain events into user-visible messages. They should help users decide what to inspect next: connection monitor, settings, SFTP, cloud sync, plugin manager, or support bundle.

---

## Terminal Architecture

### Local Terminal

Local terminal tabs run on the local machine. They validate renderer, keyboard input, shell startup, font configuration, and terminal settings before any remote host is involved.

Local terminal responsibilities:

- Start the configured local shell.
- Render output.
- Accept keyboard input.
- Handle resize.
- Apply terminal appearance settings.
- Apply terminal background and graphics settings without making them part of the terminal buffer.
- Detect terminal-native file-transfer prompts and privilege prompts without logging secrets.
- Keep local command state separate from remote SSH node state.

### SSH Terminal

SSH terminal tabs attach to a live node. They are consumers of an SSH connection, not the connection profile itself.

SSH terminal responsibilities:

- Present a shell channel.
- Maintain visible screen and scrollback context.
- Send input.
- Render output.
- Expose terminal observations to AI tools when approved.
- Report readiness and waiting-for-input hints.
- Reuse the node-owned SSH transport while keeping shell-channel state pane-local.
- Resolve privilege credential scope through the active terminal's owning node, not through host/title/prompt heuristics.

### Terminal Rendering And Graphics

The terminal renderer combines several layers:

- The emulator text grid and scrollback.
- Cursor, selection, command marks, and inline hints.
- Terminal image protocols such as Kitty/Sixel/iTerm2.
- App-level background images, opacity, and blur.
- Native whole-window opacity, applied separately from background-image opacity.
- Context-menu and command-bar overlays.

Only emulator text belongs to the terminal buffer. Background images and app overlays are rendering state. Terminal image placements are protocol state tied to the current screen buffer, so alternate-screen transitions clear image placements to avoid drawing TUI previews after apps such as yazi exit.

### Privilege And File-Transfer Helpers

Privilege prompts and modem transfers are terminal-adjacent helpers, not ordinary typed text:

- Prompt detection watches the active terminal output.
- Secret submission uses a dedicated secret path and must not pass through plugins, AI context, logs, recordings, or shell history.
- Local privilege credentials are scoped to local terminal use; SSH privilege credentials are scoped through active terminal -> node -> saved owner.
- X/Y/ZMODEM byte-level state lives in `oxideterm-modem-transfer`; GPUI only asks for files/directories, displays progress, and writes protocol responses back to the current PTY/channel.
- Detection must stay conservative so normal command output and full-screen TUI redraws are replayed as terminal text unless protocol context is proven.

### Command Bar And Context Actions

The command bar and terminal context menu are workspace controls. They may send text, paste, select, search, trigger transfers, or route commands, but their state should not be inferred from the terminal title or prompt text. Selection actions operate on the terminal snapshot and renderer coordinates, while mutating actions route through explicit terminal/session APIs.

### Terminal Ownership Rule

Closing a terminal pane closes that pane. It should not be interpreted as deleting the saved connection profile. Depending on runtime state, other consumers such as SFTP, forwards, or IDE may still need the node or may need reconnect.

---

## SSH Connection Registry And Runtime

The SSH connection pool keeps remote runtime state separate from UI tabs.

### Responsibilities

- Track active, idle, stale, reconnecting, and failed connections.
- Share one connection across multiple consumers where possible, or create a dedicated terminal connection when configured.
- Own physical connection state, registry consumers, health probes, and idle reclamation.
- Expose connection snapshots to the workspace runtime and monitor surfaces.
- Keep reconnect scheduling in `WorkspaceRuntimeEntity`, not in the monitor surface.

### Consumer Model

```text
Shared SSH connection
  |-- terminal consumer
  |-- SFTP consumer
  |-- forwarding consumer
  |-- IDE consumer
  `-- NodeRouter consumer

Dedicated terminal connection
  `-- terminal consumer with its own registry key and physical transport

AI and plugins use capability handles, host snapshots, or terminal hooks. They
are not `ConnectionConsumer` variants and are not physical connection owners.
```

### Monitor Model

Connection Monitor reads registry and workspace-runtime state to answer:

- Which nodes are active?
- Which are reconnecting?
- Which have failed?
- Which registry consumers are attached?
- Which forwards or transfers need attention?

### Host Tools Model

Connection Monitor also hosts resource-oriented tools for a connected node. These tools are node-level views, not terminal commands pasted into a pane.

Host Tools cover:

- Process lists and process actions.
- Docker containers and logs.
- Services.
- tmux sessions, windows, and panes.
- Package inventory.
- System logs.
- Listening ports and exposure hints.
- Filesystem and disk usage.
- Scheduled tasks.
- CPU, memory, disk, GPU, and network metrics.

Architecture rules:

- `oxideterm-connection-monitor` owns sampler commands, parser logic, row signatures, filters, action command construction, and domain DTOs.
- `oxideterm-gpui-app` renders the monitor, confirms user actions, and dispatches commands through the owning node/runtime boundary.
- Resource snapshots are runtime observations. They can refresh, become stale, or fail without mutating saved connection profiles.
- `ConnectionRegistry` owns physical SSH state, health probes, consumer bookkeeping, and idle cleanup.
- `WorkspaceRuntimeEntity` schedules active probes, handles node events, and starts or cancels reconnect jobs.
- `ForwardingRuntimeService` owns forwarding listeners and bridge tasks.
- The monitor surface owns neither SSH transport nor reconnect lifecycle.
- Heavy or repeated host sampling must not block terminal input or become the source of truth for SSH connection ownership.

---

## SFTP Architecture

Remote file transfer is a node-level capability. SFTP remains the structured browsing and preferred transfer protocol; legacy SCP is a compatibility transport for connected POSIX hosts whose SFTP subsystem is unavailable. Neither protocol should be treated as a terminal-pane feature.

### Responsibilities

- Acquire SFTP access for a connected node.
- List directories.
- Preview files.
- Upload and download files.
- Write file content when explicitly requested.
- Manage transfer progress.
- Retry or reacquire transport after reconnect when supported.

SCP opens an exec channel from the existing `NodeRouter` connection handle. It never creates an independent SSH transport, follows node disconnect/cancel ownership, rejects unsafe control-record names, contains downloads under the chosen local target, and uses generated temporary siblings for single-file replacement. Capability probes are cached only for one live connection generation, including negative results.

### Directory Transfers

Directory transfers use a different execution path than single-file transfers. The app must distinguish:

- Single file upload.
- Single file download.
- Directory upload.
- Directory download.
- Background transfer state.

The transfer record stores the selected protocol. SFTP may restart from a saved byte offset. SCP can pause and resume only while the live channel remains open; after channel loss its persisted failed record is retryable from byte zero, not resumable from the recorded byte count.

### Safety Model

Remote file writes are real writes on the target host. Before overwriting important files, users should verify path, target, and backup state. AI and plugins should use explicit targets and approvals for file writes.

---

## IDE Architecture

The IDE workspace is a remote project surface.

### Responsibilities

- Open a project root for a connected node.
- Maintain file tree state.
- Maintain editor tabs.
- Track dirty buffers.
- Save or discard changes explicitly.
- Preserve project context separately from terminal panes.

### Relationship To SFTP

IDE file operations may use the remote file layer, but the IDE is not simply an SFTP table. It owns editor state, project root, active editor tab, and dirty-buffer decisions.

### User Rule

Before closing an IDE tab or reconnecting an unstable host, check unsaved buffers. The connection can be rebuilt, but unsaved editor state still requires an explicit save/discard decision.

---

## Port Forwarding Architecture

Port forwarding is a connection-level capability.

### Forward Types

- **Local**: local port to remote target.
- **Remote**: remote port to local target.
- **Dynamic**: SOCKS-style dynamic forwarding.

### Runtime Responsibilities

- Create listeners or remote forward requests.
- Track running, failed, stopped, or suspended state.
- Attach forwards to an owning node.
- Restore saved or suspended forwards when reconnect succeeds.
- Show actionable errors when ports conflict or connections fail.

### Auto-Start Rule

Use auto-start only for forwards that should start whenever the owning connection opens. Otherwise, start forwards manually from the forwarding surface.

---

## Graphics And VNC Sessions

Graphics sessions are visual runtime surfaces. They are separate from terminal buffers even when a terminal or command launches the remote visual program.

The detailed RDP/VNC/X11 ownership boundary is tracked in [Remote Desktop Boundary](../../design/remote-desktop-boundary.md). Native currently treats visual remoting as three related but separate paths:

- **WSL Graphics**: `oxideterm-wsl-graphics` owns WSL distro probing, VNC server startup, desktop/app child processes, and cleanup.
- **Remote Desktop**: `oxideterm-remote-desktop` and `oxideterm-gpui-remote-desktop` own the shared model, viewer state, and provider registry; `oxideterm-rdp-helper` and `oxideterm-vnc-helper` own protocol engines behind stdio. RDP reports explicit unsupported errors for integrations outside the current compatibility scope, while VNC uses the direct TCP/RFB path.
- **SSH X11 forwarding**: `oxideterm-x11-forwarding` owns DISPLAY, xauth, fake-cookie, setup rewrite, and SSH X11 channel bridge semantics; it is not a full desktop viewer.

### Responsibilities

- Track graphics sessions separately from terminal tabs.
- Start or reconnect the backing graphics session through the graphics runtime.
- Connect the GPUI viewer to the backing framebuffer source.
- Route keyboard, pointer, and scroll input to the viewer worker.
- Keep rendered frames as viewer state, not terminal output or scrollback.

### Ownership Rule

The graphics runtime owns the server/session process lifecycle. The GPUI viewer owns the client connection, current framebuffer, pointer geometry, and input dispatch. Closing the viewer should stop or detach the graphics session according to the chosen action, but it should not rewrite saved SSH connection profiles.

For RDP/VNC sessions, `oxideterm-connections` owns saved profile metadata and secret references, while the app tab/session owns the helper process lifecycle and the GPUI viewer owns framebuffer and input state. RDP/VNC protocol code lives in helper binaries or protocol-specific crates, not in `oxideterm-gpui-app`; an SSH node supplies tunnel or node context only when the session is launched through that node.

## Reconnect And Recovery

Reconnect is a workflow across several subsystems, not a terminal-only event.

### Recovery Inputs

A recovery attempt may need:

- Node state.
- Connection status.
- Terminal panes.
- SFTP transfers.
- Forward rules.
- IDE workspaces.
- Notifications and errors.

### Conceptual Pipeline

```text
detect stale state
  -> snapshot affected consumers
  -> attempt reconnect
  -> recreate or refresh terminal access
  -> restore forwards
  -> resume or retry transfers
  -> reopen or refresh IDE state
  -> update monitor and notifications

AI and plugin capability handles are not direct reconnect stages. They observe
node or connection generation changes through their runtime boundary and must
invalidate, refresh, or reacquire resources on a later call.
```

### User Workflow

1. Open Connection Monitor.
2. Identify the affected node.
3. Reconnect or wait for reconnect.
4. Refresh SFTP, IDE, forwarding, or AI target state.
5. Verify any write, transfer, or command result.

---

## Settings And Persistence

Settings are durable application state. The desktop Settings surface is the primary way to edit them interactively.

### Settings Domains

- General app behavior.
- Appearance and theme.
- Terminal behavior.
- Local terminal behavior.
- Terminal graphics, background images, and transfer helpers.
- SSH behavior.
- Privilege credentials.
- SFTP behavior.
- IDE behavior.
- AI providers and model settings.
- AI memory, tool use, and knowledge settings.
- Plugins.
- Cloud sync.
- Portable runtime.
- Keybindings.
- Help and update channel.

### Persistence Rule

Settings should store configuration, not secret values. Secret fields should write to secret-aware storage.

Privilege credential entries are split: labels, prompt matchers, enabled state, and saved-node scope are configuration; passwords or equivalent secret values must be stored only through the secret-aware boundary.

### CLI Relationship

The CLI companion is the script and maintenance entry point for the shared
persistent model. It covers settings, connections, forwards, plugins, quick
commands, secrets, portable bundles, diagnostics, reports, batch plans,
backups, and cloud sync. Except for temporary GUI SSH launch, it does not own
live nodes or terminal runtime inside the desktop process. Mutating commands
normally use dry-run plans and `--yes` confirmation. For exploratory or visual
configuration, use the desktop Settings surface.

---

## Cloud Sync, Backups, And Portable Bundles

Cloud sync, backups, and `.oxide` bundles operate on persisted state, not on live terminal bytes.

### Cloud Sync

Cloud sync aligns selected local state with a configured remote backend. The
current model supports WebDAV, HTTP JSON, Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive,
GitHub Gist, S3, and Git backends, with selectable sync partitions. Automatic
upload, conflict blocking, sync history, and up to five local rollback backups
are local state-machine behavior. UI and CLI use the same structured sync
model; live nodes and terminal buffers are not sync objects. It should be
inspectable before direction-changing actions such as push, pull, apply, or
conflict resolution.

### Backups

Backups protect users before high-impact changes:

- Bulk imports.
- Sync apply.
- Restore.
- Plugin migration.
- Settings migration.
- Portable bundle import.

### Portable Bundles

`.oxide` bundles are encrypted portable exports. They can contain connections, forwards, settings, plugin settings, quick commands, and optional portable secrets.

### Review Rule

Every import, restore, or sync apply should be previewable. Support bundles should be reviewed before sharing.

## OxideSens AI Architecture

OxideSens is a workspace-aware assistant. It uses configured providers and local app context; it does not require an OxideTerm account.

Agent Skills are a bounded instruction layer for repeatable workflows. The AI runtime discovers `SKILL.md` catalogs, loads full instructions and resources only on demand, and records the loaded skill hash in conversation metadata. Loading a skill does not grant runtime authority; terminal, file, credential, network, and other actions still require the existing capability and approval checks.

The chat surface also resolves a provider-aware reasoning level for the selected model. Known models are normalized against capability data; an unknown model with a known provider uses that provider's request format, while an unknown provider is treated as unsupported.

OxideSens has two execution backends. The native provider backend streams the
configured model protocol directly; the ACP backend uses an independent agent
process, ACP session, model selection, and session configuration. They share
the application context, policy, and UI, but their transport, tool injection,
reasoning configuration, and lifecycle are different. ACP does not use the
native provider's `reasoning_effort` field; its options belong to the ACP
session configuration.

### Context Sources

- Conversation history.
- Current terminal context.
- Saved connections.
- Live nodes.
- Terminal sessions.
- SFTP targets.
- IDE workspaces.
- Settings summaries.
- RAG knowledge collections.
- MCP resources and tools.
- Previous tool results.

### Orchestrator Tool Model

The AI tool layer exposes high-level app tools rather than arbitrary internal APIs. Examples include:

- Target discovery and selection.
- Connect target.
- Run command.
- Observe terminal.
- Send terminal input.
- Read resource.
- Write resource.
- Transfer resource.
- Open app surface.
- Get state.
- Recall or remember preferences.

### Approval Model

AI actions are classified by risk:

- Read-only.
- Interactive.
- Execute.
- Write.
- Destructive.

Writes, terminal input, command execution, file changes, and destructive operations should be explicit and reviewable. Secrets should never be pasted into prompts.

---

## Plugin Architecture

Plugins extend the app through manifest-declared capabilities and host-provided surfaces.

### Components

- Plugin manifest.
- Plugin registry.
- Plugin host API.
- Plugin settings.
- Plugin secrets.
- Plugin UI surfaces.
- Plugin lifecycle events.

### Boundary Rules

- Plugin settings are not plugin secrets.
- Plugin UI should use the host-provided API.
- Plugin errors should be isolated from the main workspace.
- Plugin permissions should be reviewed before enabling a plugin.
- A plugin should not receive unrelated app internals by default.

---

## CLI Companion Boundary

The `oxideterm` CLI companion shares configuration and data paths with the desktop app, but it is not the primary interactive interface.

Use the CLI for:

- Headless diagnostics.
- CI validation.
- Scripted settings changes.
- Connection export or validation.
- Backup and restore automation.
- Cloud sync automation.
- Support bundle generation.
- Portable bundle validation.

Do not use the CLI as the normal way to drive interactive SSH work when the desktop app is available.

---

## Security Design

### Secret Categories

- SSH passwords.
- Private key passphrases.
- Cloud sync tokens.
- AI provider keys.
- Plugin tokens.
- Portable bundle passwords.
- Environment-derived credentials.

### Storage Rules

- Navigation metadata is not secret storage.
- Secret fields should use keychain-backed or secret-aware storage.
- CLI secret writes should prefer stdin or environment variables.
- Support bundles should contain hints and status, not raw values.
- AI context should be redacted before leaving the app boundary.

### Output Boundaries

Treat these as output boundaries:

- AI prompts.
- Tool-call payloads.
- Logs.
- Support bundles.
- Plugin messages.
- Cloud sync snapshots.
- CLI JSON output.

---

## Performance Design

### Terminal Responsiveness

Terminal hot-path work should avoid:

- Blocking disk I/O.
- Cloud sync work.
- Backup generation.
- Large plugin scans.
- Long AI summarization.
- Heavy settings serialization.

### Virtualized Views

Large lists such as files, transfers, connections, plugin entries, or logs should use stable row dimensions and virtualization where appropriate.

### Background Work

Long-running operations should show progress and avoid blocking the main workspace:

- SFTP transfers.
- X/Y/ZMODEM transfers.
- Host resource sampling.
- Graphics/VNC frame updates.
- Cloud sync.
- Backups.
- AI provider calls.
- Plugin loading.
- Remote file previews.

---

## Detailed Module Structure

### GPUI Workspace Modules

| Module | Responsibility | User-Visible Result |
|---|---|---|
| `workspace.rs` and `workspace/root/*` | Compose the top-level workspace and construct app services; long-lived node/reconnect ownership lives in `workspace/runtime_entity.rs` and domain crates | The app opens into one coherent desktop workspace without making the root view the owner of every transport |
| `workspace/tabs/*` | Create, select, render, and reconnect tab-bound views | Terminal, SFTP, IDE, and utility pages can be opened, closed, and restored independently |
| `workspace/pane_tree.rs` | Hold split-pane layout state | Users can arrange work without changing the underlying node or session ownership |
| `workspace/sidebar/*` | Render activity navigation, saved sessions, AI sidebar, and sidebar state | Navigation stays stable while the active work surface changes |
| `workspace/session_manager/*` | Manage saved connections, import/export dialogs, and connection tree/table views | Users can create, edit, import, export, and organize connection records |
| `workspace/new_connection/*` | Own the connection form, SSH connection flow, host-key dialog, and keyboard-interactive dialog | First connection setup is a guided desktop workflow, not a CLI-only path |
| `workspace/connection_monitor/*` | Track pool state, node health, topology, resource metrics, host tools, and lifecycle actions | Users can see connected nodes, resource status, host entities, reconnect state, and actionable failures |
| `workspace/sftp/*` | Render remote file browsing, dialogs, previews, conflicts, and transfer actions | SFTP is a node-level file manager, not a terminal add-on |
| `workspace/file_manager/*` | Render local file browsing, bookmarks, preview dialogs, and external open actions | Local file workflows use the same desktop patterns as remote files |
| `workspace/graphics.rs` and `workspace/graphics_vnc.rs` | Render graphics sessions, connect the VNC viewer, and route pointer/keyboard input | Visual remote workflows are separate app surfaces, not terminal scrollback |
| `workspace/remote_desktop/*` | Resolve remote desktop targets, open viewer tabs, and bridge provider/helper lifecycle into the workspace | RDP/VNC sessions use the same tab shell while keeping protocol work outside the app crate |
| `workspace/runtime_entity.rs` | Own long-lived node subscriptions, reconnect workers, runtime shutdown, and terminal-consumer bookkeeping | Closing a terminal consumer does not accidentally close a shared node or transport |
| `workspace/ide.rs` and IDE crates | Open folders, route file operations, and manage editor state | Remote editing is presented as a workspace, not as raw SFTP operations |
| `workspace/forwards/*` | Render forwarding forms, rules, state, and actions | Port forwarding is visible and recoverable from the desktop app |
| `workspace/settings/*` | Render settings pages for terminal, appearance, AI, SFTP, IDE, privilege credentials, portable runtime, updates, and keybindings | Configuration is app-first and persists through the shared settings model |
| `workspace/cloud_sync/*` | Render sync status, confirmations, and backup actions | Cloud sync and backup operations are explicit and reversible where possible |
| `workspace/plugin_entity.rs`, `plugin_manager.rs`, `plugin_lifecycle/*`, `plugin_ui.rs` | Coordinate plugin discovery, lifecycle, host API snapshots, settings, secrets, and UI host calls | Plugins can extend app surfaces without owning core runtime state |
| `workspace/sidebar/ai/*` | Render AI conversations, model selection, streaming, context, Agent Skills, tool events, and transcript state | OxideSens appears as an integrated workspace assistant with explicit tool boundaries |
| `workspace/acp_workspace.rs` and `oxideterm-acp-*` integration | Coordinate ACP agent configuration, sessions, model options, and ACP host-tool bridging beside the native provider path | ACP sessions have an independent agent/session lifecycle and are not ordinary provider streams |
| `workspace/terminal_context_actions.rs` | Build terminal context-menu actions for selection, search, transfers, and command routing | Terminal actions share app menu style while still dispatching through explicit session APIs |
| `workspace/quick_commands*` and `terminal_command_bar/*` | Store quick commands, command-line completion providers, and sender controls | Repeated terminal actions become reusable desktop controls |
| `workspace/terminal_command_sender.rs` and `terminal_command_bar/sender.rs` | `TerminalCommandSenderEntity` owns scheduled, repeatable, multi-target terminal input, target snapshots, cancellation, and progress | Jobs do not depend on root-view polling or create SSH connections; the Entity remains coordinated by `WorkspaceApp` and uses existing terminal targets |
| `workspace/local_terminal_background.rs` and `workspace/root/background.rs` | Resolve app and terminal background image rendering | Background images are visual settings, not terminal buffer content |
| `workspace/notification_center.rs` | Collect and render actionable app notifications | Background failures and recovery actions are visible without blocking terminal input |
| `workspace/onboarding/*` | Render first-run setup and setup state | Users can configure the main app without starting from CLI documentation |

### SSH Domain Modules

| Module | Responsibility | Architectural Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `oxideterm-ssh/src/config.rs` | Define SSH connection configuration and validation-facing types | Saved metadata is kept separate from live transport handles |
| `connection_registry.rs` | Track reusable SSH connections and pool identity | Multiple consumers can share a node without each owning a socket |
| `router.rs` and `router/node_router.rs` | Route work to nodes and enforce node identity | User actions target nodes, not incidental terminal tabs |
| `router/runtime_store.rs` | Store in-process node state and export topology snapshots | `WorkspaceApp` helpers persist snapshots; runtime handles, terminal endpoints, and live identities are rebuilt rather than serialized |
| `router/events.rs` | Publish node and connection events | UI and tools receive state changes without polling every domain directly |
| `reconnect.rs` | Describe reconnect policy and retry behavior | Disconnects become recoverable lifecycle events where possible |
| `monitor.rs` | Convert lower-level state into monitor-facing health | Connection Monitor can show health without exposing transport internals |
| `host_key.rs` | Handle host-key verification semantics | Trust decisions stay explicit and auditable |
| `transport/auth.rs` | Handle password, key, agent, and keyboard-interactive authentication paths | Credential collection is isolated from ordinary UI state |
| `transport/client.rs`, `connection.rs`, `handler.rs`, `output.rs` | Open SSH clients, channels, handlers, and output streams | Terminal and file consumers share transport behavior but keep separate view state |
| `transport/paths.rs`, `signers.rs` | Resolve SSH paths and signing helpers | Key material and path resolution stay in the transport layer |

### Connection Monitor And Host Tools Modules

| Module | Responsibility | Architectural Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `oxideterm-connection-monitor/src/profiler.rs` | Own sampling cadence, shell setup, timeout limits, and profiler state | Sampling is runtime observation, not saved connection data |
| `metrics.rs`, `summary.rs`, `stats.rs` | Parse metrics and build compact monitor rows | UI rows are derived from structured snapshots, not raw command text |
| `process.rs` | Filter, sort, display, and build actions for processes | Process actions are explicit host-tool commands, not terminal keystrokes |
| `docker.rs`, `service.rs`, `tmux.rs` | Model host managers and their actions | Manager-specific parsing stays in the monitor domain |
| `package.rs`, `log.rs`, `port.rs`, `filesystem.rs`, `scheduled_task.rs` | Sample package inventory, logs, ports, filesystems, and scheduled tasks | Resource tools can fail independently without changing SSH node ownership |

### SFTP Domain Modules

| Module | Responsibility | Architectural Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `oxideterm-sftp/src/session.rs` | Own high-level SFTP session behavior | File browsing is tied to a node-level session |
| `session/basic.rs` | Provide basic session operations | Simple operations use one consistent session entry point |
| `session/file_ops.rs` | Implement read, write, rename, delete, and metadata operations | Mutating file operations stay outside UI rendering code |
| `session/preview.rs` and `preview_helpers.rs` | Build safe previews for text, media, and unsupported content | Preview logic is separated from transfer logic |
| `session/transfers.rs` | Bridge sessions to upload/download operations | Transfers reuse node/session state instead of terminal commands |
| `transfer_manager.rs` | Track transfer queue, status, progress, and cancellation | Users can inspect and cancel long-running file operations |
| `progress.rs` | Represent progress events and byte counts | UI progress is structured rather than parsed from text |
| `retry.rs` | Centralize retry decisions | Recoverable network failures do not need ad hoc UI retries |
| `tar_transfer.rs` | Handle directory transfers through archive-based paths where appropriate | Directory upload/download can remain efficient and progress-aware |
| `path_utils.rs` | Normalize and validate remote paths | Remote path behavior stays consistent across SFTP and IDE |
| `types.rs` and `error.rs` | Define common SFTP DTOs and errors | UI surfaces can display precise errors without depending on implementation details |

### AI Domain Modules

| Module | Responsibility | Architectural Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `chat.rs` and `types.rs` | Define conversation and message types | UI transcript state is based on structured records |
| `context_window.rs` | Decide what fits into the model context | Token budgeting is centralized instead of scattered through the sidebar |
| `context_sanitizer.rs` | Redact sensitive values before model or tool boundaries | AI context is an output boundary |
| `key_store.rs` and `touch_id.rs` | Store and unlock provider keys | Provider credentials stay out of normal settings text |
| `providers/*` and `streaming/*` | Discover models, select providers, build requests, and parse streaming responses | Provider differences are hidden behind shared streaming semantics |
| `reasoning.rs` | Normalize reasoning levels against provider and known-model capabilities | Unsupported provider formats are not emitted; ACP uses session options instead |
| `acp/*` | Own ACP transport, agent lifecycle, session configuration, and protocol state | ACP is a separate execution backend from native model providers |
| `orchestrator.rs` | Define orchestrator tool names, schemas, and dispatch contracts | Tool definitions remain stable for model-facing behavior |
| `policy.rs` | Decide which tool actions need approval or rejection | Dangerous or state-changing actions are not executed solely because a model requested them |
| `persistence.rs` | Store conversations and AI durable state | Long-running chat history survives app restarts where configured |
| `profiles.rs` and `settings.rs` | Manage AI profiles and settings | Model/provider choices are user configuration, not hardcoded defaults |
| `rag/*` | Chunk, embed, store, and search knowledge sources | Retrieval is a domain service, not sidebar rendering logic |
| `mcp/*` | Manage MCP registry, process startup, and protocol types | External tool servers are isolated from core app state |
| `references.rs`, `slash.rs`, `suggestions.rs` | Provide references, slash commands, and suggestions | Assistant input helpers remain separate from provider transport |

### Persistence, Settings, Plugin, And Sync Crates

| Area | Native Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Settings | `oxideterm-settings`, `oxideterm-settings-model`, `oxideterm-gpui-settings-view` | Settings are loaded and saved through shared models, then rendered by GPUI pages |
| Saved connections | `oxideterm-connections`, session manager modules | Connection records are durable; active nodes are runtime objects |
| Forwarding | `oxideterm-forwarding`, app forwarding modules | Rules are configuration; listeners are runtime state |
| Privilege credentials | Settings privilege page, terminal privilege prompt, secret-aware storage | Scope and prompt matchers are configuration; secret values stay outside ordinary settings |
| Terminal modem transfers | `oxideterm-modem-transfer`, `oxideterm-gpui-terminal` modem worker | Protocol state is terminal-runtime work; file selection and progress are UI concerns |
| Graphics sessions | `oxideterm-wsl-graphics`, `oxideterm-remote-desktop`, `oxideterm-gpui-remote-desktop`, `oxideterm-rdp-helper`, `oxideterm-vnc-helper`, app graphics/remote-desktop modules | WSL lifecycle, remote protocol helpers, viewer framebuffer, and terminal buffers have separate owners |
| Plugins | `oxideterm-plugin-*`, plugin manager and lifecycle modules | Manifests, settings, host API calls, and plugin secrets have separate boundaries |
| Cloud sync | `oxideterm-cloud-sync`, `oxideterm-gpui-cloud-sync`, app cloud-sync modules | Sync plans, backup creation, and apply steps are explicit control-plane operations |
| Portable runtime | `oxideterm-portable-runtime`, settings portable-runtime modules | Portable metadata and encrypted payload handling are separate from normal settings pages |
| Notifications | `oxideterm-notification-center`, app notification module | Background status is surfaced as actionable notifications |
| CLI companion | `oxideterm-cli` | CLI reads and mutates shared state for automation, but does not replace the desktop workflow |

### Why This Split Matters

The module split preserves four user-visible invariants:

1. A view can be closed without destroying the underlying durable object.
2. A runtime object can recover without rewriting the saved profile.
3. A background operation can fail without blocking terminal input.
4. A secret can be used for authentication or provider access without becoming ordinary app text.

## Data Flow Walkthroughs

### First Launch And Local Terminal

```text
app start
  -> load settings
  -> initialize workspace state
  -> render onboarding or main workspace
  -> create local terminal tab
  -> attach local PTY
  -> stream output to terminal renderer
```

The local terminal path is intentionally short. It should not wait for cloud sync, plugin scans, AI provider discovery, or remote connection checks.

### Saved SSH Connection Open

```text
Sessions
  -> select saved connection
  -> load connection record
  -> collect missing credentials if needed
  -> verify host key if needed
  -> open SSH transport
  -> register node runtime
  -> create terminal/SFTP/IDE/forward consumer as requested
  -> publish health to Connection Monitor
```

The saved connection remains durable metadata. The live node is created only after transport setup succeeds or enters a reconnectable state.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Sessions as Sessions Surface
    participant Store as Connection Store
    participant Auth as Auth / Host-Key Flow
    participant SSH as SSH Transport
    participant Router as Node Router
    participant Monitor as Connection Monitor
    participant Tabs as Workspace Tabs

    User->>Sessions: Open saved connection
    Sessions->>Store: Load connection record
    Store-->>Sessions: Metadata without raw secrets
    Sessions->>Auth: Collect missing credentials and trust decision
    Auth->>SSH: Start transport
    SSH-->>Router: Connected handle or reconnectable failure
    Router->>Monitor: Publish node health
    Router->>Tabs: Create requested consumer tab
    Monitor-->>User: Show connected / reconnecting / failed state
```

### Terminal Input And Output

For local terminals:

```text
keyboard input -> terminal pane -> local PTY -> output stream -> renderer
```

For SSH terminals:

```text
keyboard input -> terminal pane -> node shell channel -> SSH transport -> output stream -> renderer
```

Terminal text is not a reliable structured API. Features that need file metadata, transfer progress, forward state, or tool results should use domain APIs rather than scraping terminal output.

### SFTP List And Preview

```text
SFTP page
  -> select node
  -> acquire SFTP session for node
  -> list remote path
  -> normalize entries
  -> render file list
  -> preview selected file through preview logic
  -> surface permission/network/unsupported-content errors
```

Preview is separate from download. A preview may cap file size, choose a renderer, or refuse unsupported content while normal transfer remains available.

### SFTP And SCP Upload And Download

```text
user starts transfer
  -> build transfer request
  -> enqueue in transfer manager
  -> choose SFTP, or legacy SCP when configured/required
  -> stream bytes through the node-owned session or exec channel
  -> emit progress events
  -> handle conflict/retry/cancel
  -> update transfer list and notification center
```

Single-file transfers can stream directly. SFTP directory transfers may use archive-based helpers where that preserves structure and progress semantics. SCP directory transfers use bounded legacy `C`/`D`/`E` control records and do not provide offset restart.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant UI as SFTP Surface
    participant Manager as Transfer Manager
    participant Session as SFTP Session
    participant SSH as SSH Node
    participant Notify as Notification Center

    User->>UI: Start upload or download
    UI->>Manager: Enqueue transfer request
    Manager->>Session: Acquire node session
    Session->>SSH: Stream file bytes
    SSH-->>Session: Progress / error / completion
    Session-->>Manager: Structured transfer event
    Manager-->>UI: Update row state and progress
    Manager-->>Notify: Completion, retry, or failure notification
```

### IDE Open And Save

```text
open IDE workspace
  -> choose node and root path
  -> load tree through remote file APIs
  -> open file into editor buffer
  -> edit locally in workspace state
  -> save through remote write path
  -> clear dirty state or show save failure
```

The editor buffer is a view/workspace object. The remote file is durable state on the node. Save is the explicit bridge between them.

### Forward Creation

```text
forward form
  -> validate local/remote ports and direction
  -> bind rule to node or saved connection
  -> start listener through forwarding runtime
  -> publish running/suspended/failed state
  -> recover or suspend when node health changes
```

Forward rules can be persisted, but an active listener depends on node health and local port availability.

### AI Tool Call

```text
user message
  -> build redacted context
  -> select model/provider
  -> stream model response
  -> parse tool request
  -> evaluate policy and target
  -> request user approval when required
  -> execute through domain runtime
  -> append structured result to transcript
```

AI tools do not get implicit shell ownership. A command, file read, file write, or settings action must resolve to an allowed target and pass policy.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Sidebar as AI Sidebar
    participant Context as Context Builder
    participant Provider as AI Provider
    participant Policy as Tool Policy
    participant Approval as Approval UI
    participant Executor as Tool Executor
    participant Domain as Domain Runtime

    User->>Sidebar: Send message
    Sidebar->>Context: Build redacted context
    Context->>Provider: Stream request
    Provider-->>Sidebar: Tool proposal
    Sidebar->>Policy: Check tool, intent, and target
    alt Approval required
        Policy->>Approval: Request user approval
        Approval-->>Policy: Approved or rejected
    end
    Policy->>Executor: Execute allowed tool
    Executor->>Domain: Run command / read file / update state
    Domain-->>Executor: Structured result
    Executor-->>Sidebar: Append tool result to transcript
```

### Cloud Sync Apply And Backup

```text
user opens sync
  -> load local state summary
  -> fetch or read remote snapshot
  -> build preview/plan
  -> ask for confirmation when applying changes
  -> create backup if required
  -> apply selected mutations
  -> show result and conflicts
```

The preview step is part of the architecture, not a decorative screen. It gives users a chance to understand mutations before persistent state changes.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Sync as Cloud Sync Surface
    participant Planner as Sync Planner
    participant Backup as Backup Runtime
    participant Store as Local State
    participant Remote as Remote Snapshot

    User->>Sync: Open sync or restore action
    Sync->>Store: Load local summary
    Sync->>Remote: Fetch remote snapshot
    Sync->>Planner: Build preview plan
    Planner-->>User: Show mutations and conflicts
    User->>Sync: Confirm selected apply
    Sync->>Backup: Create safety backup when required
    Sync->>Store: Apply selected mutations
    Store-->>Sync: Result and conflicts
```

### Plugin Enable

```text
plugin manager
  -> discover manifest
  -> validate metadata and permissions
  -> load settings defaults
  -> request credentials if needed
  -> enable lifecycle hooks
  -> expose host API snapshot
  -> render plugin-provided surfaces or actions
```

Plugins receive snapshots and host API calls. They should not directly own SSH transports, terminal panes, or secret storage.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant PM as Plugin Manager

## State Machines And Lifecycles

### Saved Connection Lifecycle

| State | Meaning | Next Common Actions |
|---|---|---|
| Draft | Form data exists but is not durable | Save, test, discard |
| Saved | Durable connection record exists | Connect, edit, export, delete |
| Edited | User changed fields but has not committed them | Save changes or revert |
| Imported | Record was created from an import flow | Review, save, connect |
| Exported | Record was included in an export operation | Continue using locally or share the export |
| Deleted | Durable record was removed | Existing live nodes may continue until closed |

### SSH Node Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> SavedOnly
    SavedOnly --> Connecting: user opens connection
    Connecting --> Connected: transport established
    Connecting --> Failed: auth / network / host-key failure
    Connected --> Idle: no foreground consumers
    Idle --> Connected: consumer attaches
    Connected --> Stale: health check fails
    Idle --> Stale: network changes
    Stale --> Reconnecting: retry policy starts
    Reconnecting --> Connected: transport recovered
    Reconnecting --> Failed: retry exhausted
    Failed --> Connecting: user retries or edits config
    Connected --> Disconnected: user closes node
    Failed --> Disconnected: user dismisses runtime
    Disconnected --> [*]
```

| State | Meaning | User Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Saved only | Profile exists, no live connection | Can be connected later |
| Connecting | Transport is being opened | Dependent views wait or show progress |
| Connected | Node is live and usable | Terminal, SFTP, IDE, forwards, AI tools can target it |
| Idle | Node is connected but has no active foreground consumer | Monitor can still show it |
| Stale | Last known connection is no longer trustworthy | Consumers should pause or refresh |
| Reconnecting | Retry policy is attempting recovery | Views should avoid destructive assumptions |
| Failed | Connection attempt or recovery failed | User action is required |
| Disconnected | Runtime object was closed | Views must detach or ask to reconnect |

### Terminal Lifecycle

| State | Meaning | User Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Created | Pane/tab exists | Startup may still be in progress |
| Starting | PTY or SSH channel is opening | Input may be delayed |
| Ready | Terminal can accept input | Normal interaction |
| Busy | Command is producing output | Terminal stays responsive but output volume may be high |
| Waiting for input | Process is prompting | AI observation and user controls can report this state |
| Closed | Channel or PTY is gone | View can show exit state or close |

### File Transfer Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Queued
    Queued --> Running: worker starts
    Running --> Completed: bytes finished
    Running --> Retrying: recoverable error
    Retrying --> Running: retry succeeds
    Retrying --> Failed: retry exhausted
    Running --> Suspended: node unavailable
    Suspended --> Running: node recovered
    Suspended --> Canceled: user cancels
    Running --> Canceled: user cancels
    Failed --> Queued: user retries
    Completed --> [*]
    Canceled --> [*]
```

| State | Meaning | User Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Queued | Transfer request exists | Waiting for worker capacity or node readiness |
| Running | Bytes are moving | Progress is visible |
| Retrying | A recoverable failure occurred | Progress may pause |
| Suspended | Node or app state prevents progress | User can reconnect or cancel |
| Completed | Transfer finished | Result is visible in transfer history |
| Failed | Transfer cannot continue | Error and retry options should be shown |
| Canceled | User stopped the transfer | Partial output may require cleanup |

For SCP, `Suspended --> Running` means a new retry from byte zero after the node recovers. It must not reuse the saved transferred-byte count as an SCP protocol offset.

### Modem Transfer Lifecycle

| State | Meaning | User Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Detected | Terminal output matched a conservative protocol trigger | User may be prompted for a file or directory |
| Prompting | UI is waiting for local path selection | Protocol bytes are held by the transfer consumer where needed |
| Running | Worker is exchanging protocol frames with the PTY/channel | Progress, cancellation, and errors should be visible |
| Completed | Transfer finished and terminal state is released | File result is visible at the chosen path |
| Canceled | User canceled or the terminal closed | Protocol consumer must release terminal output |
| Failed | Protocol or I/O error occurred | User can retry with a clearer command/path |

### Forward Lifecycle

| State | Meaning | User Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Configured | Rule exists but no listener is active | Can be started |
| Starting | Listener or remote channel is being opened | Port may not be usable yet |
| Running | Forward is active | Traffic can pass |
| Suspended | Owning node is unavailable or policy paused it | Rule remains visible |
| Stopped | Listener is closed by user or app | Can be restarted |
| Failed | Bind, permission, or connection error occurred | User must change rule or recover node |

### Graphics Session Lifecycle

| State | Meaning | User Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Available | Graphics support can be started | User can launch a visual session |
| Starting | Server/session process and VNC viewer are being prepared | Viewer may show progress |
| Active | VNC frames and input are flowing | User can interact with the visual surface |
| Disconnected | Viewer or backing session stopped | User can reconnect or launch again |
| Failed | Prerequisites, server startup, or viewer connection failed | User should inspect prerequisites or stop the session |

### IDE Buffer Lifecycle

| State | Meaning | User Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Clean | Buffer matches last loaded or saved content | Closing is safe |
| Dirty | User has unsaved edits | Closing or switching may prompt |
| Saving | Write is in progress | UI should avoid duplicate saves |
| Save failed | Write failed | Buffer remains dirty |
| Conflict | Remote state changed unexpectedly | User needs compare/overwrite/reload decision |
| Closed | Buffer is no longer visible | Remote file is unchanged unless saved |

### AI Tool Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Proposed
    Proposed --> PolicyChecked: parse tool call
    PolicyChecked --> WaitingApproval: approval required
    PolicyChecked --> Running: safe and target valid
    PolicyChecked --> Rejected: policy denies
    WaitingApproval --> Running: user approves
    WaitingApproval --> Rejected: user rejects
    Running --> Result: domain returns success
    Running --> Failed: execution error
    Result --> [*]
    Rejected --> [*]
    Failed --> [*]
```

| State | Meaning | User Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Proposed | Model requested a tool | No side effect yet |
| Policy checked | Tool was compared against policy and target state | May proceed, reject, or require approval |
| Waiting approval | User decision is required | Execution is paused |
| Running | Tool is executing | Result should be streamed or summarized |
| Result | Tool completed | Transcript records structured output |
| Rejected | Policy or user denied it | Transcript records denial |
| Failed | Execution failed | Error is shown without leaking secrets |

### Sync And Plugin Lifecycles

| Area | States | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Cloud sync | Unconfigured, ready, previewing, applying, conflict, completed, failed | Sync is a plan-and-apply workflow, not silent background mutation |
| Plugin | Discovered, installed, enabled, failed, disabled, updated, removed | Plugin availability is separate from plugin runtime health |

### Event Sources

The app receives structured events from multiple domain entities and task
channels. There is no single workspace event bus through which every event
must pass. Each entity owns its subscriptions, delivery wakeups, state
projection, and cancellation rules; notification severity and secret
redaction happen at the concrete output boundary.

The app receives events such as:

- SSH node status changes.
- Terminal readiness and process state.
- Terminal privilege prompt state and modem transfer progress.
- Graphics/VNC connection, frame, and disconnect state.
- Host tool sampling status, resource snapshots, and action results.
- SFTP transfer progress and conflicts.
- Forward start, stop, suspend, and failure.
- IDE save, conflict, and reload outcomes.
- Plugin install, enable, disable, settings, and host API failures.
- Cloud sync preview, apply, conflict, and backup results.
- AI tool proposals, approvals, execution results, and policy rejections.

### Notification Rules

Notifications should be actionable and scoped:

- A notification should point to the page that can resolve it.
- It should not contain raw credentials, request headers, tokens, or terminal buffer dumps.
- Repeated events should coalesce when they describe the same underlying condition.
- Terminal input should not be blocked by unrelated background notifications.
- Support bundle suggestions should explain what will be included and what is excluded.

### Refresh Versus Events

Events are the primary way to keep active pages current. Explicit refresh remains necessary when:

- A page was inactive during many state changes.
- The app recovered from sleep or network changes.
- A plugin or external tool changed durable state.
- A domain reports that its cached view may be stale.

The UI should not become the source of truth for connection health, transfer state, or persisted settings. It renders state owned by the relevant domain.

### Staleness Rules

Staleness means "the app cannot prove this state is current." It does not automatically mean data is deleted or corrupted.

- A stale node should stop accepting new high-risk operations until refreshed or reconnected.
- A stale file listing should offer refresh before destructive actions.
- A stale forward should show suspended or failed state rather than pretending traffic is flowing.
- A stale AI target should require target re-selection or tool rejection.

## Failure Model

| Symptom | First Surface To Check | Subsystem | Likely Cause | Recovery Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Terminal tab closed but host still appears connected | Connection Monitor | Tabs and node runtime | A tab is a view; the node can outlive it | Close the node from Connection Monitor if it is no longer needed |
| Terminal opens but does not accept input | Terminal tab | Terminal runtime | PTY/channel is still starting or failed readiness | Wait for readiness, reopen terminal, or reconnect the node |
| Terminal output is delayed during large operations | Terminal tab and Notification Center | Data plane contention | A heavy background task may be competing for resources | Pause transfers/sync or wait for the task to complete |
| TUI preview leaves a stale block after exit | Terminal tab | Terminal graphics/image placement | Full-screen app did not fully clear image placement or alternate-screen state | Clear screen, reopen the terminal, or file a terminal rendering bug with the captured command |
| Saved terminal background does not appear | Terminal or runtime page | Terminal background rendering | Background setting is not enabled for that surface or the image library selection is stale | Re-select the image, check enabled tab types, or reload the surface |
| Privilege password helper does not trigger | Terminal tab and Privilege settings | Terminal helper | Prompt was not detected or the active session has no matching credential scope | Check active terminal scope, prompt matcher, and saved credential ownership |
| Wrong privilege password is submitted | Terminal tab and Privilege settings | Secret scope resolution | Credential was scoped to the wrong local/SSH owner | Stop the command, edit the credential scope, and retry after prompt returns |
| Modem transfer opens unexpectedly | Terminal tab | Modem protocol detector | Output looked like a protocol prelude without enough context | Cancel helper, continue terminal output, and report the trigger sample |
| Modem transfer stalls | Transfer prompt or notification | Modem transfer engine | Peer stopped responding, path prompt was canceled, or protocol negotiation failed | Cancel or retry with an explicit `rz`/`sz` command and a stable local path |
| SSH connection fails before password prompt | New Connection or Sessions | SSH transport | Host, port, proxy, or DNS is incorrect | Edit connection settings and test again |
| Host-key prompt appears unexpectedly | Host-key dialog | SSH trust boundary | Remote host key changed or first connection is untrusted | Verify the fingerprint before accepting |
| Keyboard-interactive auth repeats | New Connection dialog | SSH auth | Server requested additional answers or rejected credentials | Re-enter answers, update saved credentials, or check server auth policy |
| Node shows reconnecting for a long time | Connection Monitor | Reconnect orchestrator | Network is unavailable or retry policy is still active | Wait, cancel reconnect, or edit connection details |
| Host Tools page is empty or stale | Connection Monitor / Host Tools | Connection monitor samplers | Node is stale, sampler command failed, or parser rejected output | Refresh, reconnect the node, or inspect the action error |
| Host Tools action fails | Host Tools action dialog | Connection monitor action path | Permission denied, missing binary, stale node, or command failure | Review confirmation output, adjust permissions, and retry on the live node |
| Node is connected but SFTP cannot open | SFTP page | SFTP session | Server lacks SFTP support or session acquisition failed | Reconnect, check server subsystem, or use terminal fallback |
| Remote file list is empty or outdated | SFTP page | SFTP listing/cache | Path changed, permission denied, or cached view is stale | Refresh path, navigate upward, or check permissions |
| SFTP upload stalls | Transfer list | Transfer manager | Network interruption, remote disk pressure, or suspended node | Resume/retry, reconnect node, or cancel partial transfer |
| Directory transfer is slow | Transfer list | SFTP transfer strategy | Many small files or archive helper fallback | Let the transfer complete or split the directory |
| Preview refuses a file | Preview dialog | SFTP preview | File is too large, binary, unsupported, or permission denied | Download/open externally or use terminal tools |
| Forward is suspended | Forwarding and Connection Monitor | Forwarding runtime | Owning node is stale or disconnected | Reconnect node or stop the forward |
| Forward fails to start | Forwarding page | Forwarding runtime | Local port is already used, permission denied, or remote bind failed | Change port, close conflicting process, or edit direction |
| Traffic does not pass through a running forward | Forwarding and terminal/network tool | Forwarding runtime | Remote endpoint is unavailable or rule targets the wrong host/port | Test endpoint from the remote host and edit rule |
| VNC viewer is blank or disconnected | Graphics / VNC page | Graphics session runtime | Viewer cannot reach forwarded endpoint or backing session stopped | Reconnect viewer, restart the graphics session, or inspect prerequisites |
| IDE workspace opens but tree is missing files | IDE workspace | IDE FS | Root path is wrong, permissions block listing, or cache is stale | Refresh tree or open another root |
| IDE save fails | IDE workspace and Connection Monitor | IDE write path | Node disconnected, permission denied, conflict, or remote file changed | Reconnect, resolve conflict, or save to another path |
| Unsaved editor changes remain after reconnect | IDE workspace | Editor buffer | Reconnect restores node access, not implicit file writes | Save explicitly after reconnect |
| AI wants to run on a saved host | AI approval and Sessions | AI target selection | Saved profile is not a live shell target | Connect the host first or choose another active target |
| AI tool is rejected | AI sidebar | AI policy | Tool is dangerous, missing approval, or target is not allowed | Approve when prompted, narrow target, or use a safer request |
| AI context omits recent terminal output | AI sidebar | Context window | Token budget or redaction removed data | Attach the needed context explicitly or ask for a narrower task |
| AI provider call fails | AI settings and AI sidebar | Provider transport | Missing key, invalid model, quota, or network failure | Update provider settings and retry |
| Plugin setting changed but page did not update | Plugin manager and affected page | Plugin lifecycle | Page needs refresh or plugin event did not re-render the view | Refresh page, disable/enable plugin, or restart app |
| Plugin fails to enable | Plugin manager | Plugin registry/lifecycle | Manifest invalid, permission denied, missing dependency, or secret unavailable | Review plugin details, update settings, or remove plugin |
| Cloud sync conflict appears | Cloud Sync | Sync planner | Local and remote durable state changed independently | Review preview, choose local/remote resolution, then apply |
| Backup generation fails | Cloud Sync or backup dialog | Backup runtime | Destination unavailable, permission denied, or secret redaction failure | Choose another destination or reduce selected data |
| Portable runtime cannot unlock | Portable settings | Portable runtime | Wrong passphrase, missing key material, or corrupted payload | Re-enter passphrase, restore backup, or recreate portable data |
| CLI report differs from app view | CLI and app page | Shared state boundary | CLI reads persisted state while app also has live runtime state | Refresh app state or compare with Connection Monitor |
| Support bundle lacks expected data | Support bundle dialog | Output boundary | Secret redaction or selected scope excluded it | Regenerate with the right scope, still excluding raw secrets |

## Tauri Reference Mapping

| Tauri Architecture Section | Native Architecture Equivalent |
|---|---|
| React frontend layer | GPUI workspace shell and app surfaces |
| Tauri command backend | Rust domain crates and runtime integrations |
| Data plane | Terminal hot path |
| Control plane | Structured app/domain commands |
| SessionTreeStore and AppStore split | Saved connection store, node runtime state, connection monitor snapshots |
| Oxide-Next node sovereignty | Node-first runtime model |
| SFTP on connection rather than terminal | Node-level SFTP architecture |
| Host/resource side panels | Connection Monitor / Host Tools architecture |
| Terminal protocol helpers | Terminal privilege helpers and X/Y/ZMODEM modem transfer engine |
| Visual remote sessions | Graphics / VNC session architecture |
| ReconnectOrchestratorStore | Native reconnect orchestration model |
| AI sidebar and tools | OxideSens AI architecture |
| Plugin runtime | Plugin registry, host API, lifecycle, settings, secrets |
| SettingsStore | Settings domain crates and Settings surface |
| `.oxide` format and backups | Portable bundles, backups, cloud sync |

The implementation details are native GPUI/Rust rather than Tauri/React, but the architectural intent is the same: keep terminal hot-path work responsive, route remote capabilities through stable node identity, separate user views from runtime owners, and keep secrets out of ordinary app text.
